SVA IxD Slow Code, Fall 2013
============================

Overview
--------

In Slow Code, students write homegrown code and share it with their local class- mates. Like the Slow Food Movement, the class advocates the benefits of using locally grown produce (code) and skillfully judging the origins of globally produced food (code-libraries/snippets). Students are given time to learn the craft, explor- ing how it relates to their unique skillsets and interests. At minimum, they learn how to code as well as use other peopleâ€™s code efficiently. At best, the craft will grow its roots into their perception of systems, processes, and ultimately enrich their creative processes.
